If you are as paranoid as I am, using the syncthing global discovery and relay
servers is an absolute  no go. Therefore, it is necessary to  have a quick and
easy deployment  of those; isolating them  in containers is a  plus since they
are mostly stateless and require close to no storage.

This whole repository  is an application of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming][literate  programming]] using emacs'
[[https://orgmode.org/][org-mode]] and  [[https://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/babel/][org-babel]] to generate code  along with the documentation  from a
single  file  (the process  is  called  /tangling/).   The  very basic  idea  is
/“Documentation first,  code after”/, forcing  /lazy little shits/ like  myself to
write the  documentation beforehand, which  helps having  a clear idea  of the
resulting code.

* Getting started
  
  Grab a local copy  of this repository and go into one  of the three provided
  folders.

** Prerequisites

   No  prerequisites  whatsoever  except,  of  course,  your  usual  container
   runtime.

** Installation & usage

   Simply [[https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/build/][build]] your own containers with  the provided files; the build process
   makes sure  only the latest  binary is  installed, which means  updating the
   container requires rebuilding it.

   That being said, clone the repository.

   #+begin_src shell
     git clone git@github.com:scheatkode/syncthing.git
     git clone https://github.com/scheatkode/syncthing
   #+end_src

   Or if you prefer [[https://gitlab.com/][GitLab]].

   #+begin_src shell
     git clone git@gitlab.com:scheatkode/syncthing.git
     git clone https://gitlab.com/scheatkode/syncthing
   #+end_src

   Next step  is building the  container from one  of the provided  files. For
   instance, to build a syncthing relay based on Debian :

   #+begin_src shell
     podman build --file relay/dist/containerfile-debian --tag syncthing-relay
   #+end_src

   If you use Docker (/shame on you/) :

   #+begin_src shell
     docker build --file relay/dist/containerfile-debian --tag syncthing-relay
   #+end_src

* Contributing

  Feel free to modify or contribute however you want.
